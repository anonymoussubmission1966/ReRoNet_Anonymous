# RERO: Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Segmentation & Scoring

An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for coronary artery calcium (CAC) lesion segmentation and Agatston scoring from cardiac CT scans. The pipeline covers dataset preparation, heart ROI masking, dual-window HU intensity handling, model training (custom RERO architecture and SwinUNETR), evaluation with clinically relevant metrics, and comparison against nnU-Net baselines.

---

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Preprocessing (`pre_process.py`)** — Generates and caches Heart ROI masks for faster inference. These masks are used both for ROI-based masking in the pipeline and, optionally, as an additional input channel. The dataset is also split according to a configurable strategy — **Distribution-Optimally-Balanced Stratified Cross-Validation (DOB-SCV)** or **Simple Stratified Cross-Validation** — producing a MONAI-compatible split dictionary saved to `MetaData/splits.json`.
2. **Dataset construction (`dataset.py`)** — Reads `MetaData/splits.json` and builds MONAI datasets and dataloaders. Includes:
   - Coordinate convolution (CoordConv) channels
   - Heart ROI mask channel
   - Dual HU windowing (separate windows for calcium and soft tissue)
   - A strong augmentation suite: `RandCropByPosNegLabeld` (pos=3, neg=1), `RandAffined`, `Rand3DElasticd`, `RandGaussianSmoothd`, `RandGaussianNoised`, `RandAdjustContrastd`, `RandShiftIntensityd`, and others
3. **Training (`train.py`)** — Trains the RERO model (or SwinUNETR variant) using the configured splits and augmentations.
4. **Evaluation (`eval.py`, `resampled_eval.py`)** — Loads a trained checkpoint by experiment name and computes segmentation and scoring metrics via `metric.py`. `resampled_eval.py` additionally evaluates robustness to resampling (resampling invariance).
5. **Inference (`wrapper.py`)** — Takes a NIfTI file as input and returns model predictions end-to-end.

All configuration — dataloader, dataset, preprocessing, model, training, evaluation, and dual-HU-windowing parameters — is centralized in **`config.py`**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

**Local:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Remote:** ensure PyTorch is installed first (matching your CUDA version), then:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_for_remote.txt
```

### 2. Configure the pipeline

Edit `config.py` to set preprocessing, dataset, dataloader, model, training, evaluation, and dual-HU-windowing parameters — including the choice between DOB-SCV and Simple SCV splitting strategies.

### 3. Preprocess and generate splits

```bash
python pre_process.py
```

This generates/caches Heart ROI masks and writes the split dictionary to `MetaData/splits.json`.

### 4. Train

```bash
python train.py <your_experiment_name>
```

### 5. Evaluate

```bash
python eval.py  <your_experiment_name>
```

The checkpoint is loaded from the file please edit resampled_eval.py`.

For resampling-invariance checks:
```bash
python resampled_eval.py 
```

### 6. Run inference on a new scan

Use `wrapper.py` to run predictions on a single NIfTI file end-to-end.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Supplementary EDA plots and the scripts used to generate them are available in `EDA_Extra/`, including t-SNE projections of patient-level calcium features by Agatston risk category, log-transformed frequency distributions, and examples of segmentation errors that motivated refactoring of the COCA preprocessing scripts.
